Go combines the efficiency of compiled languages like C with the simplicity and readability of interpreted languages like Python, making it ideal for building scalable, high-performance applications.

A go.mod file lists all external dependencies your project requires, along with their specific versions to ensure your project always uses the same version of each dependency.

This is similar to how the gcc (GNU Compiler Collection) command compiles C code into a binary in a typical C program. This is ideal when you want to distribute the program as an executable. The go run command compiles and runs the Go code in a single step. It doesn't produce a binary file. Instead, it compiles the source code in memory and immediately executes it. This is ideal for quick tests or development when you don't need the compiled binary file. </p> <p>You have now built and run your first Go program!</p> <ul> <li>Primary author: Krisha Avula</li> <li>Reviewer: Kevin Ma</li> </ul> <p>This tutorial uses information from Starting a Static Website Project with MkDocs by Kris Jordan</p>"}]}
